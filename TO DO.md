# TO DO 

- hardware fix on M-Brain: protect TRRS sockets from delivering 12V to the I2C SCL and SDA connections when connecting cables after the unit is already powered
- (hardware) fix M-Fader and M-Knob
- make code for: M-Encoders and M-Trackpad
- implement USB MIDI 

# NOTES

- the M-Encoder board is a bit messy
