# TO DO 

- hardware fix on M-Brain: protect TRRS sockets from delivering 12V to the I2C SCL and SDA connections when connecting cables after the unit is already powered

- (hardware) fix M-Fader and M-Knob

- make code for: M-Encoders and M-Trackpad

- M-Brain: check resetMsg() - does it need to be called so often ??? 

- M-Brain: resetMsg() function name is misleading!! Change name

- M-Brain: line:272 - does setting the global channel needs to have an I2C message received ?!?!?!

- make M-Brain code a bit more efficient (leave original code to facilitate understanding)

- implement USB MIDI 


# NOTES

- the M-Encoder board is a bit messy: clean it up!
