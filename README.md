# M-Blocks
Modular MIDI Controllers

## CHANGELOG

### version 0.0.1 (first prototype)
First working sketch containing two modules (MBrain and MToggle).
In this version the controller (MToggle) acts as a Slave device and MBrain acts as a Master device, where the slave is constantly sending data to the master with a flag to let the master know if data has changed or not.
